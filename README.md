## ü§î A Few Things to Keep in Mind

Before we dive in, it's important to understand a few things about how image generation models work and to be aware of some common misconceptions.

*   **Not all images are created equal:** Some images are inherently harder to generate than others. A model might excel at creating portraits but struggle with complex scenes with multiple subjects.
*   **The "Best-of" bias:** Providers and users often showcase their best results, which can create a skewed perception of a model's capabilities. It's important to remember that you are often seeing the highlights, and not the average result.
*   **The power of the dataset:** Image and video generation models are trained on vast datasets of images. However, these datasets are not uniformly distributed. For example, images of a person walking down the street are much more common than images of a knight riding a dragon. This distribution influences the model's ability to generate certain types of images.
*   **Style bias:** A scene can be strongly associated with a particular style in the training data. For instance, scenes from Tolkien's Silmarillion are more likely to be associated with book illustrations than with a cinematic, IMAX-style scene. This can make it challenging for the model to generate images in a style that is not well-represented for a given subject in its training data. This is why it is sometimes difficult to generate things that don't "already exist" in a way in the training data.
*   **What does it mean to "create"?** The question of whether AI models "create" art is a fascinating one, and it echoes a debate that dates back to ancient Greece. For Plato, art was a form of *mimesis* (imitation), but he saw it as a mere copy of the physical world, which was itself a copy of a higher reality of "Forms". In this view, art is twice removed from the truth. Aristotle also saw art as mimesis, but for him, it was a creative act of "recomposing" elements from nature to reveal deeper, universal truths.

    This ancient debate provides a powerful lens through which to understand modern generative models. Like Plato's artist, a generative model is, in a sense, "copying" from the vast dataset of images it has been trained on. It operates within a high-dimensional space that is entirely constrained by this data. However, like Aristotle's artist, the model can also be seen as "recomposing" these existing elements in novel ways to create something that has never been seen before. It can blend styles, combine objects, and generate new compositions based on the statistical patterns it has learned.

    So, while a generative model doesn't "create" in the human sense of the word, it does more than just copy. It navigates a complex space of possibilities, guided by a prompt, to produce a new image that is a "recomposition" of what it has learned. This is why it is sometimes difficult to generate things that don't "already exist" in some form in the training data.

### üö´ Prompt 17: The Pitfall of Proper Nouns

A common mistake is to use proper nouns (like names of characters or places from fiction) when aiming for a realistic image. The model may have been trained on data where these words are associated with illustrations or specific art styles, which can prevent it from generating a photorealistic image. It's often better to describe the characteristics of the person or place you have in mind.

Here is an example of a prompt that uses a proper noun, and a better version that is more descriptive.

**Version 1 (with proper noun):**

*Leica M10, 50mm Summilux lens, cinematic scene. Capture an over-the-shoulder, close-up view from ground level, showing a Valyrian lord as he faces his impending doom. He stands tall, back to us, adorned in a white robe richly embroidered with gold, his long white hair flowing down his back, and a golden laurel wreath resting upon his head. The scene is epic, set against the backdrop of a massive lava meteor hurtling towards him, filling the frame with its fiery form and trailing smoke. He is standing on an antique stone-paved plaza, surrounded by marble statues, with the vast expanse of Valyria stretching out beyond. The sky is a stunning blue with a magnificent light, a stark contrast to the impending fiery doom. Use a shallow depth of field to focus on the lord and the meteor, with a slightly blurred background. Use dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, rich textures, 8K resolution, baroque painting meets Gucci style, high contrast, and film grain. The scene is ultra-realistic, capturing the lord's despair and the immense scale of the approaching cataclysm.*

**Version 2 (descriptive):**

*Leica M10, 50mm Summilux lens, cinematic scene. Capture an over-the-shoulder, close-up view from ground level, showing a lord from a glorious titanic city with Greco-Roman architecture as he faces his impending doom. He stands tall, back to us, adorned in a white robe richly embroidered with gold, his long white hair flowing down his back, and a golden laurel wreath resting upon his head. The scene is epic, set against the backdrop of a massive lava meteor hurtling towards him, filling the frame with its fiery form and trailing smoke. He is standing on an antique stone-paved plaza, surrounded by marble statues, with the vast expanse of the city stretching out beyond. The sky is a stunning blue with a magnificent light, a stark contrast to the impending fiery doom. Use a shallow depth of field to focus on the lord and the meteor, with a slightly blurred background. Use dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, rich textures, 8K resolution, baroque painting meets Gucci style, high contrast, and film grain. The scene is ultra-realistic, capturing the lord's despair and the immense scale of the approaching cataclysm.*

## üé® Model Diversity: Same Prompt, Different Results

One of the most fascinating aspects of generative AI is that different models, even when given the exact same prompt, will produce vastly different results. This is because each model has its own unique training data, architecture, and fine-tuning, which gives it a distinct "artistic personality."

Here is a prompt that was used to generate images from four different models.

**The Prompt:**

> 35mm film look movie still, ARRI Alexa, Summilux lens: Hyperrealistic photography, photorealistic quality, cinematic grain. A dramatic, low-angle shot captures an immense, fat pirate figure dominating the frame, embodying raw, imposing power. He smiles menacingly, his face dominated by a long, hooked nose and a wide, gap-toothed grin revealing crooked, yellowed teeth. Thick unkempt black beard and hair spilling from beneath a black captain's hat and turquoise bandana. A voluminous, crimson captain's coat with intricate golden trim and epaulets is draped open over his bare, muscular chest. He wears multiple striking necklaces: one composed of large, lustrous green beads and another of gold links interspersed with deep purple discs. Rings adorn his fingers, and a bracelet graces his wrist. A swirling mass of inky dark mist radiates from one of its clenched fist, while the other fist is surrounded by a sphere of pure white light. The background is a sun-drenched, slightly blurred expanse, suggesting a vast, open battleground under a bright sky, with shallow depth of field keeping the colossal figure sharply in focus.

## üèÜ Choosing the Best Models

Choosing the right model is crucial for generating high-quality images. Fortunately, there are leaderboards that rank models based on their performance. These leaderboards use a system called the Elo rating system to provide a relative ranking of the models.

### üìä The Elo Rating System

The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess. It's also used to rank AI models. The basic principle is that each model has a rating, and when two models are compared, the winner takes points from the loser. The number of points gained or lost is determined by the difference in the ratings of the two models.

If a lower-rated model wins against a higher-rated model, it will gain more points than if a higher-rated model wins against a lower-rated model. This system allows for a dynamic and fair ranking of models over time.

### üîó Leaderboards and Testing

Here are some resources to help you choose the best model for your needs:

*   **[LMSys Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/?chat-modality=image)**: This is a platform where you can test and compare different models for free. You can prompt two anonymous models side-by-side and vote for the one that you think performs better. This helps to contribute to the overall ranking of the models.
*   **[Artificial Analysis Leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/text-to-image/arena?tab=leaderboard-text)**: This is a leaderboard that ranks text-to-image models based on their Elo rating. It's a great resource to see which models are currently performing the best.

## üé¨ **Cinematic Effects & Jargon**
